<h2>File Names</h2>

<p>When naming files in Faro Stream they must be named in the following structure</p>
<p>(Ship Name)_(Venue)</p>

<p>Here are some examples</p>
<p>Koningsdam_Lido</p>
<p>Nieuw_Statendam_Salty_Dog</p>
<p>Enchanted_Princess_Good_Spirits</p>

<p>It is imperative that the deck is <em>NOT</em> included in the file name, this is because each venue is sorted alphabetically.</p>
